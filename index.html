          <p>Hi im Squidward I've recently moved here to the moon to get away from my annoying neighbors spongebob and patrick.
           Unfortunately for me one of them has followed me here. I need your help to keep them away from my house.
           If you wouldn't mind placing these clones of mine by clicking in the yellow box im sure
           the music they play will keep patrick at bay 
          </p>
